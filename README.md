# @shakacode-tools/react-on-rails-rsc

This package provides React Server Components (RSC) support for the [`react-on-rails-pro`](https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails_pro) Ruby gem. 

⚠️ **IMPORTANT: This package is for internal use only** ⚠️

This package is not intended to be used directly by end users. It is designed to be used internally by [`react-on-rails-pro`](https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails_pro) npm package and ruby gem.

## Usage
